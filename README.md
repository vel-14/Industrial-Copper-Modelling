# Industrial-Copper-Modelling
## Overview:
This project aims to address sales and pricing challenges within the copper industry using machine learning techniques. By implementing regression models for predicting 'Selling_Price' and classification models for lead status determination, the project streamlines decision-making processes. The solution includes data preprocessing steps and a user-friendly Streamlit interface for easy access.

## Project Structure:

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing: 
This section explores data skewness, identifies outliers, and performs necessary preprocessing steps to ensure data suitability for analysis.

### Regression Model for Selling Price Prediction: 
Implement a regression model to predict the 'Selling_Price' of copper products, enhancing pricing decision accuracy.

### Classification Model for Lead Status Determination: 
Develop a classification model to evaluate and classify leads as 'Success' (WON) or 'Failure' (LOST), improving lead capture efficiency.

### Streamlit Interface: 
Create a user-friendly interface using Streamlit, allowing users to input data columns and obtain predicted 'Selling_Price' values or lead status classifications effortlessly.
